# 🔄 Swap Two Numbers (Without Temporary Variable)

This C++ program swaps the values of two integers **without using a third (temporary) variable**.

Perfect for practicing logic building, arithmetic operations, and input/output in C++.

## 🚀 What It Does

🔹 Prompts the user to enter two integers `a` and `b`  
🔹 Swaps the values using arithmetic (`+` and `-`)  
🔹 Displays the values before and after swapping

---

## 🖥️ Example Output

Enter first number (a): 5
Enter second number (b): 10
Before swap: a = 5 , b = 10
After swap: a = 10 , b = 5
